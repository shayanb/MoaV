## Do I Need a Domain?

**No.** MoaV can run without a domain in **domain-less mode**. A domain unlocks more protocols, but several work with just an IP address.

| Protocol | Requires Domain | Port |
|----------|:-:|------|
| Reality (VLESS) | No | 443/tcp |
| WireGuard | No | 51820/udp |
| WireGuard (wstunnel) | No | 8080/tcp |
| AmneziaWG | No | 51821/udp |
| Telegram MTProxy (telemt) | No | 993/tcp |
| Admin Dashboard | No | 9443/tcp |
| Conduit (Psiphon donation) | No | — |
| Snowflake (Tor donation) | No | — |
| Trojan | **Yes** | 8443/tcp |
| Hysteria2 | **Yes** | 443/udp |
| TrustTunnel | **Yes** | 4443/tcp+udp |
| CDN (VLESS+WebSocket) | **Yes** (Cloudflare) or **No** (CloudFront) | 2082/tcp |
| dnstt (DNS tunnel) | **Yes** (NS records) | 53/udp |
| Slipstream (QUIC-over-DNS) | **Yes** (NS records) | 53/udp |

**Domain-dependent protocols** need a valid TLS certificate (via Let's Encrypt) or NS delegation, which both require a domain.

---

## Domain-less Mode

Leave `DOMAIN=` empty in your `.env` file. MoaV automatically detects this and runs only protocols that work without a domain:

- **Reality** — VLESS with TLS camouflage (uses `REALITY_TARGET` like `dl.google.com` instead of your own domain)
- **WireGuard** — Full VPN, direct UDP or tunneled over WebSocket (TCP) when UDP is blocked
- **AmneziaWG** — DPI-resistant WireGuard with packet-level obfuscation
- **Telegram MTProxy** — Direct Telegram access via fake-TLS, no VPN needed
- **Admin Dashboard** — Web UI with self-signed certificate
- **Conduit / Snowflake** — Bandwidth donation (optional)

This is ideal for:
- **Raspberry Pi** or home servers without a registered domain
- Quick deployments when you can't register a domain
- Environments where only VPN-style protocols are needed

You can upgrade to a full domain setup later — just set `DOMAIN=` in `.env` and run `moav bootstrap`.

### Port Forwarding (Domain-less)

If running on a home network, forward these ports on your router:

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 443/tcp | TCP | Reality (VLESS) |
| 51820/udp | UDP | WireGuard |
| 8080/tcp | TCP | wstunnel (WireGuard over WebSocket) |
| 51821/udp | UDP | AmneziaWG |
| 993/tcp | TCP | Telegram MTProxy |
| 9443/tcp | TCP | Admin Dashboard |

> No port 80 needed — domain-less mode doesn't use Let's Encrypt.

---

## Domain Setup

If you have a domain, you unlock all 13+ protocols. How many DNS records you need depends on which features you enable.

### Minimum Setup (Without DNS Tunnels)

If you don't need DNS tunnels (dnstt / Slipstream), you only need one record:

```
Type: A
Name: @ (or your domain name)
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IP
TTL: 300 (or Auto)
```

This enables: Reality, Trojan, Hysteria2, TrustTunnel, CDN mode, and all domain-less protocols.

### Full Setup (With DNS Tunnels)

#### Step 1: Main A Record

```
Type: A
Name: @ (or your domain name)
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IP
TTL: 300
```

#### Step 2: DNS Server A Record

```
Type: A
Name: dns
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IP
TTL: 300
```

This creates `dns.yourdomain.com` pointing to your server (used as the nameserver for tunnel subdomains).

#### Step 3: NS Delegation for dnstt

```
Type: NS
Name: t
Value: dns.yourdomain.com
TTL: 300
```

This tells DNS resolvers that queries for `*.t.yourdomain.com` should be sent to `dns.yourdomain.com` (your server). Used by dnstt.

#### Step 4: NS Delegation for Slipstream (Optional)

```
Type: NS
Name: s
Value: dns.yourdomain.com
TTL: 300
```

Same concept as dnstt, but for the Slipstream QUIC-over-DNS tunnel. Slipstream is 1.5-5x faster than dnstt. Only needed if `ENABLE_SLIPSTREAM=true`.

#### Optional: IPv6 Support

If your server has IPv6, you can also add an AAAA record for the nameserver:

```
Type: AAAA
Name: dns
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IPV6
TTL: 300
```

> **More Info**: For detailed dnstt documentation, see the [official dnstt guide](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/).

### Summary of All DNS Records

| Record | Name | Value | Proxy | Purpose | Required? |
|--------|------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| A | `@` | Server IP | DNS only | Main domain (Trojan, Hysteria2, Reality) | Yes |
| A | `dns` | Server IP | DNS only | Nameserver for DNS tunnels | Only for dnstt/Slipstream |
| NS | `t` | `dns.domain.com` | — | dnstt tunnel subdomain | Only for dnstt |
| NS | `s` | `dns.domain.com` | — | Slipstream tunnel subdomain | Only for Slipstream |
| A | `cdn` | Server IP | **Proxied** | CDN-fronted VLESS | Only for CDN mode |
| A | `www` | Server IP | **Proxied** | CDN stealth connect address | Optional (CDN stealth) |
| A | `grafana` | Server IP | **Proxied** | Grafana via CDN | Optional (monitoring) |

---

## Provider-Specific Instructions

### Cloudflare

1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Select your domain
3. Go to DNS → Records
4. Add records:

**Important:** Set proxy status to "DNS only" (gray cloud) for most records. Only CDN-related records should be "Proxied" (orange cloud).

| Type | Name | Content | Proxy status |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| A | @ | YOUR_IP | DNS only |
| A | dns | YOUR_IP | DNS only |
| NS | t | dns.yourdomain.com | — |
| NS | s | dns.yourdomain.com | — |
| A | cdn | YOUR_IP | **Proxied** (orange cloud) |
| A | www | YOUR_IP | **Proxied** (orange cloud) |
| A | grafana | YOUR_IP | **Proxied** (orange cloud) |

> The `cdn`, `www`, and `grafana` records are optional:
> - `cdn` — Required if you want CDN-fronted VLESS (`ENABLE_CDN=true` or CDN_SUBDOMAIN set)
> - `www` — Recommended for CDN stealth. Used as the CDN connect address so DNS queries don't reveal the "cdn" subdomain to DPI. Set `CDN_ADDRESS=www.yourdomain.com` in `.env`
> - `grafana` — Only needed if you want faster Grafana loading via CDN (see [Monitoring Guide](MONITORING.md#cloudflare-cdn-for-faster-grafana-recommended))
>
> All other records **must** be DNS only (gray cloud).

#### CDN Origin Rule (Required for CDN Mode)

If you added the `cdn` record above, you **must** also create an Origin Rule to redirect traffic to port 2082. By default, Cloudflare's Flexible SSL connects to origin port 80, but MoaV's CDN listener runs on port 2082.

**Step 1: Go to Rules → Origin Rules**

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard, select your domain
2. Navigate to **Rules** → **Origin Rules**
3. Click **Create rule**

**Step 2: Configure the Rule**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Rule name | `CDN to port 2082` |
| When incoming requests match... | **Hostname** equals `cdn.yourdomain.com` |
| Then... | **Destination Port** → Rewrite to `2082` |

**Step 3: Deploy**

Click **Deploy** to activate the rule.

**Verify it works:**
```bash
# Should return HTTP 400 (sing-box responding, not Cloudflare 521)
# Use any path - the CDN WS path is auto-generated during bootstrap
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://cdn.yourdomain.com/test
```

A `400` or `404` response means sing-box is receiving the request.
- `521` = Origin Rule is missing or misconfigured
- `525` = SSL mode is wrong — set Cloudflare SSL/TLS to **Flexible** (not Full/Strict), because MoaV's CDN port 2082 is plain HTTP

> **Important:** Cloudflare SSL/TLS mode must be set to **Flexible** for CDN mode. MoaV's CDN inbound on port 2082 is plain HTTP (Cloudflare terminates TLS). If you need Full SSL for other subdomains, use a Configuration Rule to set Flexible for just `cdn.yourdomain.com`.

See [CDN Setup Guide](SETUP.md#cdn-fronted-vlesswebsocket-cloudflare) for complete CDN configuration.

### AWS CloudFront (Alternative CDN)

CloudFront can be used as an alternative to Cloudflare for CDN-fronted VLESS. The main advantage: **no domain required** — CloudFront gives you a `*.cloudfront.net` domain automatically. This is useful when you can't register a domain or want an additional CDN fallback.

**How it works:** Client connects to CloudFront (AWS CDN IPs) → CloudFront forwards to your server on port 2082 → sing-box handles the VLESS+WS connection. DPI only sees connections to AWS infrastructure.

#### Step 1: Create CloudFront Distribution

##### Option A: AWS Console (Web UI)

1. Log into [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
2. Click **Create Distribution**
3. Configure origin:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Origin domain | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` (or your domain) |
| Protocol | **HTTP only** |
| HTTP port | `2082` |
| HTTPS port | `443` |

4. Configure behavior:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Viewer protocol policy | **HTTPS only** |
| Allowed HTTP methods | **GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE** |
| Cache policy | **CachingDisabled** |
| Origin request policy | **AllViewer** |

5. Configure WebSocket support:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Response headers policy | None |

> CloudFront supports WebSocket natively — no extra configuration needed.

6. Click **Create Distribution** and wait for deployment (5-15 minutes)
7. Note your distribution domain: `d1234abcd.cloudfront.net`

##### Option B: AWS CLI

Install and configure the CLI first:

```bash
# Install AWS CLI
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o awscliv2.zip
unzip awscliv2.zip && sudo ./aws/install

# Configure (needs AWS Access Key + Secret Key from IAM)
aws configure
```

Create the distribution (replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP`):

```bash
aws cloudfront create-distribution --distribution-config '{
  "CallerReference": "moav-cdn-'$(date +%s)'",
  "Comment": "MoaV CDN",
  "Enabled": true,
  "Origins": {
    "Quantity": 1,
    "Items": [
      {
        "Id": "moav-origin",
        "DomainName": "YOUR_SERVER_IP",
        "CustomOriginConfig": {
          "HTTPPort": 2082,
          "HTTPSPort": 443,
          "OriginProtocolPolicy": "http-only"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "DefaultCacheBehavior": {
    "TargetOriginId": "moav-origin",
    "ViewerProtocolPolicy": "https-only",
    "AllowedMethods": {
      "Quantity": 7,
      "Items": ["GET","HEAD","OPTIONS","PUT","POST","PATCH","DELETE"],
      "CachedMethods": {"Quantity": 2, "Items": ["GET","HEAD"]}
    },
    "CachePolicyId": "4135ea2d-6df8-44a3-9df3-4b5a84be39ad",
    "OriginRequestPolicyId": "216adef6-5c7f-47e4-b989-5492eafa07d3",
    "Compress": false
  },
  "PriceClass": "PriceClass_200"
}'
```

The `PriceClass` controls which edge locations (regions) are used:

| PriceClass | Regions | Cost |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `PriceClass_100` | US, Canada, Europe | Cheapest |
| `PriceClass_200` | + Asia, Middle East, Africa | Mid-tier |
| `PriceClass_All` | All edge locations worldwide | Most expensive |

> For users in Iran/Middle East, use `PriceClass_200` or `PriceClass_All` for better latency — these include Middle East and Asia edge nodes.

> **Note:** You can't pick a specific datacenter/city. CloudFront is an anycast CDN — it automatically routes users to the nearest edge location within your selected price class.

Get your distribution domain:

```bash
aws cloudfront list-distributions \
  --query 'DistributionList.Items[0].DomainName' --output text
```

Wait for deployment to complete (status changes from `InProgress` to `Deployed`):

```bash
aws cloudfront list-distributions \
  --query 'DistributionList.Items[*].[Id,DomainName,Status]' --output table
```

#### Step 2: Configure MoaV

In your `.env` file:

```bash
# Use CloudFront instead of Cloudflare for CDN
CDN_SUBDOMAIN=           # Leave empty (not using Cloudflare subdomain)
CDN_DOMAIN=d1234abcd.cloudfront.net
CDN_ADDRESS=d1234abcd.cloudfront.net
CDN_SNI=d1234abcd.cloudfront.net
CDN_TRANSPORT=ws         # Use 'ws' for widest CDN compatibility
```

Then re-bootstrap to regenerate configs:
```bash
moav bootstrap
```

#### Step 3: Verify

```bash
# Should return 400 (sing-box responding)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://d1234abcd.cloudfront.net/test
```

#### CloudFront vs Cloudflare

| Feature | Cloudflare | CloudFront |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Cost | Free tier | ~$0.085/GB (1TB free/month for 12 months) |
| Domain required | Yes | **No** (get `*.cloudfront.net`) |
| Setup complexity | DNS + Origin Rule | AWS Console distribution |
| WebSocket support | Yes | Yes |
| Origin port config | Needs Origin Rule to rewrite to 2082 | Direct port configuration |
| SNI flexibility | Can use root domain for stealth | Must use `*.cloudfront.net` or your CNAME |
| Domain fronting | Partially supported | **Blocked since 2018** |
| Global edge network | Yes (larger) | Yes |

> **SNI note:** CloudFront validates that the TLS SNI matches your distribution domain or a configured CNAME. You cannot use an arbitrary domain (like `google.com`) as SNI — AWS blocked domain fronting in 2018. For Reality-based protocols (XHTTP, VLESS+Reality), SNI camouflage works differently and does not rely on the CDN.

#### Using Both Cloudflare and CloudFront

You can run both CDN providers simultaneously for redundancy. Users get two CDN share links — if one CDN's IPs get blocked, the other likely still works:

1. Set up Cloudflare CDN as described above (requires domain)
2. Set up CloudFront as a second distribution pointing to the same server
3. Share both links with users

To generate links for both, you'd need to run bootstrap with Cloudflare settings first, then manually create CloudFront share links using the same UUID and WS path.

#### CloudFront CLI Management

```bash
# List all distributions
aws cloudfront list-distributions \
  --query 'DistributionList.Items[*].[Id,DomainName,Status]' --output table

# Check which edge location a user is hitting
curl -sI https://d1234abcd.cloudfront.net/ | grep x-amz-cf-pop
# Example output: x-amz-cf-pop: FRA56-P4 (Frankfurt)

# Disable a distribution (must disable before deleting)
# First get the ETag:
ETAG=$(aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id DIST_ID \
  --query 'ETag' --output text)
# Then disable:
aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id DIST_ID \
  --query 'DistributionConfig' --output json \
  | jq '.Enabled = false' \
  | aws cloudfront update-distribution --id DIST_ID \
    --if-match "$ETAG" --distribution-config file:///dev/stdin

# Delete (only after status is "Deployed" and distribution is disabled)
aws cloudfront delete-distribution --id DIST_ID --if-match "$ETAG"
```

### Namecheap

1. Log into Namecheap
2. Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS
3. Add records:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A Record | @ | YOUR_IP | Automatic |
| A Record | dns | YOUR_IP | Automatic |
| NS Record | t | dns.yourdomain.com. | Automatic |
| NS Record | s | dns.yourdomain.com. | Automatic |

Note: NS value may need trailing dot. The `dns`, `t`, and `s` records are only needed if using DNS tunnels.

### Google Domains / Squarespace

1. Go to DNS settings
2. Add custom records:

| Host name | Type | TTL | Data |
|-----------|------|-----|------|
| (blank) | A | 300 | YOUR_IP |
| dns | A | 300 | YOUR_IP |
| t | NS | 300 | dns.yourdomain.com |
| s | NS | 300 | dns.yourdomain.com |

### Hetzner DNS

1. Go to DNS Console
2. Select your zone
3. Add records:

```
@ IN A YOUR_IP
dns IN A YOUR_IP
t IN NS dns.yourdomain.com.
s IN NS dns.yourdomain.com.
```

## Home Servers & Raspberry Pi

MoaV runs on Raspberry Pi 4+ (2GB+ RAM) and any ARM64/x64 Linux machine. Home servers typically have dynamic IPs and sit behind a router, so you need port forwarding and (if using a domain) Dynamic DNS.

### Port Forwarding

Configure your router to forward the ports you need to your MoaV server's local IP.

**Domain-less mode** (minimum):

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 443/tcp | TCP | Reality (VLESS) |
| 51820/udp | UDP | WireGuard |
| 8080/tcp | TCP | wstunnel (WireGuard over WebSocket) |
| 51821/udp | UDP | AmneziaWG |
| 993/tcp | TCP | Telegram MTProxy |
| 9443/tcp | TCP | Admin Dashboard |

**With domain** (add these):

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 80/tcp | TCP | Let's Encrypt verification (only during certificate setup/renewal) |
| 443/udp | UDP | Hysteria2 |
| 8443/tcp | TCP | Trojan |
| 4443/tcp | TCP | TrustTunnel (HTTP/2) |
| 4443/udp | UDP | TrustTunnel (HTTP/3 / QUIC) |
| 53/udp | UDP | DNS tunnels (dnstt + Slipstream) |

**Optional**:

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 9444/tcp | TCP | Grafana monitoring dashboard |

> Only forward ports for protocols you actually enable. Check your `.env` file for `ENABLE_*` toggles.

### Before You Start

1. **Check for CGNAT**: Some ISPs use Carrier-Grade NAT which prevents incoming connections entirely. Test by comparing your router's WAN IP with `curl ipinfo.io/ip`. If they differ, contact your ISP for a public IP or use a VPS instead.

2. **Static local IP**: Assign a static IP to your MoaV server in your router's DHCP settings so port forwarding rules don't break when the local IP changes.

### Dynamic DNS (DDNS)

If you're using a domain with a home server, your ISP likely assigns a dynamic public IP that changes periodically. Dynamic DNS services automatically update your domain to point to your current IP.

> **Domain-less mode does not need DDNS.** Users connect via your public IP directly. You can find your current public IP with `curl ifconfig.me` and share it manually. If your IP changes, update the configs you shared.

### DuckDNS (Free)

DuckDNS is a free DDNS service that provides subdomains like `yourname.duckdns.org`. Let's Encrypt works with DuckDNS domains.

#### Step 1: Create Account

1. Go to [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org/)
2. Sign in with Google, GitHub, Twitter, or Reddit
3. Create a subdomain (e.g., `myvpn` → `myvpn.duckdns.org`)
4. Copy your **token** from the dashboard

#### Step 2: Install Update Script

On your MoaV server (Raspberry Pi or home server):

```bash
# Create update script
mkdir -p /opt/duckdns
cat > /opt/duckdns/duck.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
DOMAIN="YOUR_SUBDOMAIN"  # e.g., myvpn (without .duckdns.org)
TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"

curl -s "https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=${DOMAIN}&token=${TOKEN}&ip=" | logger -t duckdns
EOF

# Replace with your values
nano /opt/duckdns/duck.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x /opt/duckdns/duck.sh

# Test it
/opt/duckdns/duck.sh
```

#### Step 3: Schedule Automatic Updates

```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every 5 minutes)
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /opt/duckdns/duck.sh") | crontab -
```

#### Step 4: Configure MoaV

In your `.env` file:
```bash
DOMAIN=yourname.duckdns.org
```

Then run bootstrap as normal.

> **Note:** DuckDNS subdomains don't support NS delegation, so DNS tunnels (dnstt, Slipstream) won't work with DuckDNS. All other domain-based protocols work fine.

### Cloudflare DDNS (Own Domain)

If you have your own domain on Cloudflare, you can use the Cloudflare API to update DNS records automatically. This supports all features including DNS tunnels.

#### Step 1: Get API Token

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → My Profile → API Tokens
2. Create a token with **Zone:DNS:Edit** permission for your domain
3. Copy the token

#### Step 2: Get Zone ID

1. Go to your domain in Cloudflare
2. Scroll down on the Overview page
3. Copy the **Zone ID** from the right sidebar

#### Step 3: Install Update Script

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/cloudflare-ddns
cat > /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
CF_API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
CF_ZONE_ID="YOUR_ZONE_ID"
DOMAIN="yourdomain.com"
RECORD_NAME="@"  # Use "@" for root domain or "subdomain" for subdomain

# Get current public IP
CURRENT_IP=$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)

# Get current DNS record
RECORD_DATA=$(curl -s -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CF_ZONE_ID}/dns_records?type=A&name=${DOMAIN}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CF_API_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json")

RECORD_ID=$(echo "$RECORD_DATA" | grep -o '"id":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)
RECORD_IP=$(echo "$RECORD_DATA" | grep -o '"content":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)

# Update if IP changed
if [ "$CURRENT_IP" != "$RECORD_IP" ]; then
    echo "IP changed from $RECORD_IP to $CURRENT_IP, updating..."
    curl -s -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CF_ZONE_ID}/dns_records/${RECORD_ID}" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CF_API_TOKEN}" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data "{\"type\":\"A\",\"name\":\"${DOMAIN}\",\"content\":\"${CURRENT_IP}\",\"ttl\":300,\"proxied\":false}" | logger -t cloudflare-ddns
else
    echo "IP unchanged ($CURRENT_IP)"
fi
EOF

# Edit with your values
nano /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh

chmod +x /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh
```

#### Step 4: Schedule Updates

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh") | crontab -
```

#### Step 5: Configure MoaV

In your `.env`:
```bash
DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

### After DDNS Setup

1. **Wait for propagation**: After the first update, wait 5-10 minutes
2. **Verify**: `dig +short yourdomain.com` should show your home IP
3. **Run MoaV setup**: `moav` to start the interactive setup
4. **Test from outside**: Use mobile data (not home WiFi) to test connectivity

### Home Server Tips

- **UPS recommended**: Protect against power outages, especially for Raspberry Pi
- **Monitor uptime**: Use a free service like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to alert you if your server goes down
- **Backup regularly**: `moav export` to backup your configuration
- **Temperature**: Ensure adequate cooling for Raspberry Pi under sustained VPN load
- **SD card**: Use a high-endurance microSD card or boot from USB/SSD for reliability

---

## Verification

After configuring DNS, wait for propagation (usually 5-30 minutes, up to 48 hours).

### Verify A Record

```bash
dig +short yourdomain.com
# Should return: YOUR_SERVER_IP

dig +short dns.yourdomain.com
# Should return: YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### Verify NS Delegation

```bash
dig NS t.yourdomain.com
# Should show: dns.yourdomain.com in AUTHORITY SECTION

# Test that queries reach your server
dig @YOUR_SERVER_IP test.t.yourdomain.com
# Should get a response (after dnstt is running)
```

### Online Tools

- https://dnschecker.org - Check propagation worldwide
- https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx - Detailed DNS lookup

## Common Issues

### "DNS not propagated yet"

Wait longer (up to 48 hours in rare cases). Check with multiple DNS servers:

```bash
dig @8.8.8.8 yourdomain.com
dig @1.1.1.1 yourdomain.com
```

### "NS record not working"

- Ensure the A record for `dns.yourdomain.com` exists
- Some registrars require a trailing dot: `dns.yourdomain.com.`
- NS delegation can take longer to propagate

### "Certificate acquisition failed"

- Verify A record is correct: `dig yourdomain.com`
- Ensure port 80 is open (temporarily, for ACME HTTP-01)
- Check that no other service is using port 80
- Not applicable in domain-less mode (no certificates needed)

### "Can't connect from outside my home network"

- Verify port forwarding is configured on your router
- Check for CGNAT: `curl ifconfig.me` should match your router's WAN IP
- Ensure your ISP doesn't block the ports you need
- Test from mobile data, not your home WiFi

---

## Domain Acquisition Tips

For users in censored regions:

1. **Use privacy protection** - Hide your personal info in WHOIS
2. **Pay with crypto** if possible - For anonymity
3. **Choose a neutral TLD** - `.com`, `.net`, `.org` are less suspicious than country-specific TLDs
4. **Avoid "VPN" or "proxy" in the domain name** - Keep it generic
5. **Consider multiple domains** - Have backups ready if one gets blocked

### Domain Naming Strategy

Your domain name is the first thing DPI systems see in the TLS SNI. A good domain blends with legitimate traffic:

**Good examples:**
- Names that look like business infrastructure: `cloudops-services.com`, `cdn-platform.net`
- Names that look like SaaS products: `dataflow-sync.com`, `metrics-hub.net`
- Generic tech names: `stackbuilder.io`, `nodebridge.net`

**Bad examples:**
- Anything with "vpn", "proxy", "tunnel", "free", "bypass" in the name
- Random strings: `xk4m2p.com` (suspicious to automated systems)
- Known circumvention patterns: `v2ray-server.com`

**Subdomain naming** also matters. MoaV's CDN subdomain defaults to `cdn` — consider changing it to something like `assets`, `static`, `api`, or `app` in your `.env`:
```bash
CDN_SUBDOMAIN=assets
```

### Recommended Registrars

- Namecheap - Good privacy, accepts crypto
- Porkbun - Cheap, good privacy
- Njalla - Maximum privacy (they own the domain for you)
